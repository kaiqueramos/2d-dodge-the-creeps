## The game
This game was made with Godot 4 RC 1, but I think it is simple to run on other releases. The name in the original tutorial is 'Dodge the Creeps', but I have to change it to another name for the release. The core mechanics and gameplay loop are complete, but there is still much to improve:

* UI
* * Options
* * Stylized buttons
* * Buttons to social media
* Main mechanic
* * Lifebar to the player
* * Player can shoot the creeps
* * Creeps dying with shader effects
* * Creeps variety
* * Boss
* * Levels
* * Upgrades
* * Collectable Boosts
* History
* * Simple narrative with dialogue box
* Animations
* * Maybe some personalized animations while shooting
* * Maybe while using special boosts
